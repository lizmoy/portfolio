            <p className="about-text">Iâ€™m a Web Developer and Visual Designer interested in programming for a more equitable future. With a background in visual arts and community organizing, I bring a strong design sensibility and a wheelhouse of soft skills to the work that I do. My experience working with communities, particularly communities of color in New York City, has strengthened my knack for identifying problems and working through issues of accountability, privacy and engagement. With social impact always in mind, I hope to be building beautiful, useful, and accessible web applications.</p>
